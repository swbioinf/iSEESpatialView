# iSEESpatialView

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is a simple hack to get spatial rnaseq data displayed in
iSEE. Specifically, its for Nanostring cosMX in Seurat ojects. Can show
cells in their X-Y coordinates, with expression totals. Image data isn’t
used, only cell centroids. Transcript level information also absent.
This package is simply a temporary workaround until more dedicated
spatial experiment browsers are available for this kind of data
(e.g. VRomics, napari squidpy plugins, iSEE spatial plugins, AtoMX
updates)

TBC.

<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- You can install the development version of iSEESpatialView like so: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # w -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(iSEESpatialView) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
